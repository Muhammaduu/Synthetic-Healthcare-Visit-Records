# Healthcare Data Analysis - README

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data to extract valuable insights about patients, hospital departments, costs, and treatment trends. The dataset contains 50 observations with columns such as `Patient_ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Diagnosis`, `Total_Bill`, `Length_of_Stay`, `Department`, etc.

## üîç Questions & Solutions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check for missing values in the dataset**
Find missing values in each column.
```python
# Count missing values in each column
df.isnull().sum()
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the number of unique patients in the dataset**
```python
# Count unique Patient_IDs
df['Patient_ID'].nunique()
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Get the most common diagnosis**
```python
# Find the most frequently occurring diagnosis
df['Diagnosis'].mode()[0]
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Count the number of patients admitted in each hospital department**
```python
# Count patients per department
df['Department'].value_counts()
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Identify and remove duplicate records**

```python
# Count male and female patients
df['Gender'].value_counts()
```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Determine the percentage of male vs female patients**
```python
# Compute percentage distribution
df['Gender'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
```

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Find the department with the highest number of critical patients**
```python
# Count critical patients per department
df[df['Condition'] == 'Critical']['Department'].value_counts()
```

### **üîü Get the patient with the highest hospital bill**
```python
# Locate the row with the maximum bill
df.loc[df['Total_Bill'].idxmax()]
```

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the total revenue generated by each department**
```python
# Sum total bills per department
df.groupby('Department')['Total_Bill'].sum()
```

### **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the average cost per patient visit**
```python
# Compute mean hospital bill
df['Total_Bill'].mean()
```

### **1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the patient who stayed the longest in the hospital**
```python
# Locate the row with the maximum length of stay
df.loc[df['Length_of_Stay'].idxmax()]
```

### **1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Get the top 5 most expensive treatments**
```python
# Fetch top 5 most expensive hospital bills
df.nlargest(5, 'Total_Bill')
```

## üìä Conclusion
These analyses help understand patient demographics, financial trends, and department efficiencies in a healthcare setting. More advanced analyses can be performed using statistical modeling and machine learning.

For further enhancements, consider adding:
- **Time-series analysis** for patient trends
- **Predictive modeling** for hospital readmissions
- **Correlation analysis** for cost-driving factors

üöÄ **Happy Analyzing!**
